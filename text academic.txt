Good morning,  

Dear Sir/Madam,  
My name is Syawa Aura Qolby Wibowo from the Information Systems Study Program, class of 2023. I have an outstanding payment for this semester.  
However, I made the payment last week. Since the enrollment deadline has passed, I am unable to enroll. Could the 
academic office reopen registration for me? Or is there another solution to this issue so that I can enrollment for this semester?  

Thank you for your consideration. I look forward to your response.
